## Conversion Functions
1. kg to tonnes: convert a mass in kg into one in metric tonnes. 1000 kg is 1 tonne.

2. pound to kg: convert a mass in pounds into kilograms. 1 lbs is 0.45359237 kg.

3. km to miles: convert a distance in kilometres to miles. 1 km is 0.621371 miles.

4. daily to annual: convert a daily quantity into an annual quantity, using Gregorian years. 1 Gregorian year has 365.2425 days.

5. weekly to annual: convert a weekly quantity into an annual quantity. Again use Gregorian years. One week has seven days.

6. annual to daily: convert an annual quantity into a daily quantity. Again use Gregorian years.

## Utilities and Institutions
1. fp from gas: based on a monthly natural gas bill (in $), calculates metric tonnes of CO2E produced annually. For every dollar somebody spends monthly, 105 lbs of CO2E is emmitted annually. “CO2E” means “CO2-equivalent”, because multiple greenhouse gases (GHGs) contribute to climate change. Methane, for example, is a greenhouse gas that is four times more potent than CO2 (and a large by-product of natural gas and animal agriculture).

2. fp from hydro: based on a daily electricity usage in kWh, calculate the metric tonnes of CO2E produced annually by Hydro Qu ́ebec. Hydro Qu ́ebec reports that 0.6 kg CO2E are emitted for each MWh of electriicty. 1 MWh = 1000 kWh.
You can find your average daily electricity usage by logging in to the Hydro Qu ́ebec website. In Qu ́ebec the footprint of our electricity usage is very low relative to global standards! This is because we use mostly (about 96%) hydroelectricity, whereas in other parts of the world the standard is to make electricity from coal (which is very carbon intensive).

3. fp of utilities: based on a monthly natural gas bill (in $) and an average daily electricity usage in kWh, calculate the metric tonnes of CO2E produced annually.

4. fp of studies: based on an annual number of credits, calculate the metric tonnes of CO2E from being a student at McGill. McGill emits annually 56,004 tonnes CO2E — most of it from powering and maintaining its buildings. Not all students use the campus the same amount. In university budgeting you’ll commonly see the unit “FTE” for full-time equivalent. One full time student (30 credits) is 1 FTE; a student taking 15 credits would be 0.5 FTE. Per McGill’s 2017 Greenhouse Gas Inventory, the per-student emissions work out to 1.12 annual tonnes per FTE.

## Travel and Transportation
1. fp from driving: based on annual number of kilometers driven, calculate in metric tonnes of CO2E this produces. To get the total pounds of CO2E somebody gets from driving a given number of miles, multiply the mileage by 0.79.

2. fp from taxi uber: based on weekly average number of taxi/Uber/Lyft/etc rides, calculate annual metric tonnes of CO2E produced. For this we’ll note that 81 million Uber rides produces 100,000 metric tonnes of CO2E, and assume that taxis/Lyft/etc have the same footprint.

3. fp from transit: based on weekly average number of bus and rail (metro/exo) one-way rides, calculate annual metric tonnes of CO2E produced. You’ll want to know that:

(a) The average transit trip in Montr ́eal is 7.7 km. We’ll assume all trips have this length. 

(b) One mile by bus: 150 g CO2E

(c) One mile by subway train: 160 g CO2E

4. fp of transportaton: given somebody’s weekly bus/rail/Uber trips, and their weekly km driven calculate the annual metric tonnes of CO2E produced.

5. fp of travel: given how many annual one-way flights, intercity train rides, in- tercity coach bus rides, and spending (in $) on hotels one does, calculate the annual metric tonnes of CO2E produced.

## Computing and Diet

1. fp of computing: given how many hours a day on average you spend online, how many hours a day you use your phone, and how many new devices you bought this year, estimate the annual metric tonnes of CO2E this produces. For computing, most of the footprint comes from the manufacturing of your devices rather than their everyday usage. The materials used to make a laptop/phone/etc are carbon- intensive to mine and then assemble! And then for our phones, there’s an additional footprint from using the telecommunications infrastructure needed for connectivity (e.g. phone towers, satellites).

2. fp of diet: given the average daily consumption of meat (in g), cheese (in g), milk (in L), and eggs, estimate the annual metric tonnes of CO2E this diet produces.
(a) A vegan (no eggs/dairy/meat) diet produces 2.89 kg CO2E a day (just from the food) 

(b) Adding meat, dairy and eggs to the diet adds:

i. One gram of meat: 26.8 g CO2E

ii. One litre of milk: 267.7777 g CO2E

iii. One gram of cheese: 12 g CO2E iv. One egg: 300 g CO2E
